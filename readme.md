# What I did
- Just recursion.js, the folders were part of further study
- for parsing through anything nested, seems like mapping through it is better than cutting bits off until it reaches the length of 0.
  - (on gatherStrings) I tried to slice the Object down bit by bit but couldn't get it to work
